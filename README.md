## Develop

Note that this project is built with Native Code, unlike Create React Native App. 
If you've never worked on React Native project, refer to official docs [React Native - Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for more information on dependencies installation

I've only tried it for Android but technically speaking it should work on ios as well.
Refer to [official doc](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device.html) for ioS

#### Android
1. `npm install`
2. `react-native run-android`
